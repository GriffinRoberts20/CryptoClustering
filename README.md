# CryptoClustering
  Here I practiced using KMeans, PCA, and the elbow method. While the data, both scaled alone and scaled and PCA'd into 3
  components, had one coinciding sharp elbow, I still felt unsure if that was the right value to use for KMeans.
  I went ahead and used it, though I did experiment with a couple other values which did end up lacking when 
  plotted.
